It is clear that if there was a CTC-Bulb here on Earth and a CTC-Bulb on Mars, connected by one switch, once the switch flipped they would both turn on instantaneously. 
Yet for a mere observer of light the flip would switch on a few minutes later.

Any CTC-Apparatus [phone-like device] would easily allow for instantaneous communication.

The superliminal model of of reality dictates that at shorter distances we are merely fragmented by our own approximations of perception.
For instance, if there were two bulbs both within a short few metres of one another on planet Earth connected by one switch [same scenario as before, mechanically] then they would both turn on instantaneously,
AND seem to turn on instantaneously. Yet in the primary scenario they both turn on instantaneously but with light lag seem to turn on 14 minutes later. (It is easier to verify this from 
Earth to Moon by the way).

The best way to verify if the bulb turned on at Mars as it did on Earth, instantaneously, is by having another human [better to have a few] there with a CTC-like apparatus (a live feed device)(like an iPhone) confirming whether
or not it turned on, before a light-observer on Earth can verify it just by looking or through any means of electromagnetic communication <causality-reduction>.

The superluminal model of reality superimposes on current strata of truth and understanding that given this bulb scenario we can extrapolate, that will has very little to do with what has happened and what will happen,
i.e. the bulb was already on before it was on [seemingly causal], and for that matter all quanta [quantum substrat] is 'ever-lit' around us, and that we are surrounded by time not by space.
OOE.
